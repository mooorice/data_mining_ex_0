# Data Mining Exercise 1

Welcome to the first exercise of the Data Mining course. In this exercise, we will perform a simple Data Analysis. For my project I chose to analyze data from the European Social Survey (ESS).
I chose the most comprehensive dataset from 2018 (ESS round 9), accessed via the ESS Data Portal (https://ess.sikt.no/en/)

The data is located in /data but will not be uploaded.
An image of the boxplot is stored in /plot.
All code to reproduce the analysis can be found in script.R.
